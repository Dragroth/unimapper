# UniMapper
## A Smart Approach to Educational Choices

### 1. Introduction
UniMapper is a smart platform designed to help students make informed decisions about their education and future careers. This document provides an overview of UniMapper's core ideas, standout features, and its technical foundation.

### 2. Main Concept
At its core, UniMapper simplifies the university selection process. 
It offers students an easier way to overcome “choice paralysis” and estimate their chances of getting admitted to preferred universities. 
Through matriculation data integration it allows this without the hassle of having to manually enter academic records or search for and compare academic offers and requirements for admission.

### 3. Key Features
3.1 Predicting University Admissions
Calculate the likelihood of admission to desired universities based on students' academic records, simplifying their decision-making process.
University entrance thresholds are either taken from centralised government resource or scraped (based on prior agreement) from universities websites the moment the data is published.
3.2 Tailored University Suggestions
Filter universities and majors based on scientific interests, using keywords and tags.
3.3 Tracking Educational Progress
Post-enrollment, UniMapper provides charts and stats to monitor educational progress. These tools help identify areas where students might need extra attention or allow to take a step back and reassess current choices.
3.4 AI-Driven Career Guidance
Leveraging solutions such as Dialogflow, UniMapper will include an AI chatbot to engage students with thoughtfully crafted questions in order to help find a potential match between their interests and their academic performance, aiding them in making informed career decisions approaching graduation.

### 3.5 Future Integrations
In the future we would like to integrate UniMapper with job recruiting sites to provide career insights, including salary data. Additionally, we would aim to collaborate with government databases to be the first to access matriculation data, enhancing the accuracy of our admission predictions and eventually removing or minimising both the need for datascraping and manual data provision from our user base.

### 4. Tech Stack
UniMapper relies on a well-known tech stack to provide a seamless experience on a scalable platform:

- Frontend: Developed using React, UniMapper ensures a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- Backend: Powered by Node and Express, UniMapper delivers efficient data processing and server-side capabilities.
- Database: Data is stored in MySQL for reliability and scalability.
- Hosting: Proof of Concept for UniMapper is currently hosted on MS Azure Cloud for high availability and security.

### 5. Conclusion
UniMapper simplifies the education journey. By offering accurate admission predictions, personalised university suggestions, progress tracking, AI-driven career guidance, and future integrations, we aim to help students make informed academic and career decisions. We look forward to assisting students on their educational path through innovative technology and data.
